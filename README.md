# 🧠 Face Recognition Attendance System

This project is a practical application of the powerful `face_recognition` library in Python, designed to **identify individuals using a webcam** and log their **attendance times** in a `.csv` file — ready to be viewed in Excel! ✅

## 📌 About the Project

Using facial recognition, this system can detect and recognize well-known figures such as:

- 🤖 Elon Musk  
- ⚽ Cristiano Ronaldo  
- 🐐 Lionel Messi (recognized as **The GOAT** 😎)  
- 👤 Matin (the creator of this project)

Each time one of these individuals is detected, the system automatically logs their **entry time** into a CSV file.
